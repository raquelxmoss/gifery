# Gifery

Currently, Gifery is a whole lot of nothing, but I have some grand plans.

Users will be able to save and tag gifs from anywhere on the web, then access their gif library whenever they need to. No more saving gifs to a folder on your desktop like some sort of cavewoman. It's basically [Pocket](http://www.getpocket.com) for gifs. 

## MVP
A chrome extension that talks to an API and allows users to save, tag, and search their gifs. Gif urls can be inserted into a Facebook status, Tweet, or insightful Reddit comment with just one click.

## Eventually
World domination, obviously.

Failing that:
- More 3rd party integrations (Slack, iOS native app, Android App, Firefox extension, you get the idea)
- Search everyone's libraries by tag
- Hell, I don't know. Maybe Giphy or Reactiongifs or Reddit would want this. For reasons. 
- Maybe save gifs to the database, or save the wayback machine's record? Not sure how this would work in terms of avoiding duplicates though.
